# PM25-Forecasting-Framework

To start using the repo, we suggest:
- create a virtual environment with Python 3.21.1 
- activate the virtual environment
- install the needed packages in requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

Possible caveats:
- eccodes might need to be conda forged (if code does not run because of some eccodes issue)
